# Project Summary
The Energy Bill Analyzer is a Python-based chatbot that leverages optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to assist users in understanding and optimizing their energy usage. As a key developer, I integrated Python-tesseract for OCR and OpenAI's GPT-4 for NLP to analyze utility bills, transforming data into personalized energy-saving advice. This project addressed significant social issues by empowering users to make informed decisions about energy consumption, contributing to environmental sustainability. Challenges included the integration of multiple AI technologies and ensuring the chatbot's advice was accurate and user-friendly. My role involved extensive coding and the strategic implementation of AI functionalities to ensure the chatbot worked correctly and as needed.
